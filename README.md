# havel-halmiki
Code that applies "Havel-Hakimi" algorithm to set of numbers.
Algorithm was sourced from reddit.
Havel Hakimi algorithm is used to verify if a given sequence is graphic or not.

The theorem is as follows:
If you order a degree sequence with the degrees decreasing with the exception of one vertex, and write the degree sequence as 
d<sub>1</sub>,d<sub>2</sub>≥d<sub>3</sub>≥⋯≥d<sub>n</sub>. 
This degree sequence is graphical if and only if 
d<sub>2</sub>−1,d<sub>3</sub>−1,…,d<sub>d1+1</sub>−1,d<sub>d1+2</sub>,…,dn is also graphical.



SecondTry.java is the working code.

P.S: I thought Hakimi was Halmiki. Yeah.
